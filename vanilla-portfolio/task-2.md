Add a section 'Professional Experience' with contents below: 

UST Global (2018-2020) - In my experience as a Software Developer in UST Global, I have developed enhancements and ground-up applications using technologies like Java, Spring Framework, AngularJS, Angular, JSP, Oracle, MySQL in a Scrum framework. We were working together with our onsite team (from San Antonio, Texas US), in the development of the systems/application we are assigned to. I have a great understanding of the Scrum ceremonies and the framework itself, because the projects where I've been part of have a really great setup of Scrum.

Manulife IT Delivery Center Asia Inc. (2020-2025) -  Successfully delivered multiple Manulife Customer applications into production, ensuring seamless user experiences and meeting quality standards. 

Infor PSCC (2025) - Served as a Full-Stack Developer at INFOR PSCC, contributing to a pioneering ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) platform used by major European corporate clients, enabling scalable compliance, reporting, and data-driven sustainability decision-making.
